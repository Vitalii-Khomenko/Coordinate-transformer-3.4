Project Development and Publishing Guidelines for Coordinate Transformer

## 1. Code Standards
   - All code comments must be in English
   - Use built-in mathematical formulas for coordinate transformations (no external libraries for calculations)
   - Maintain clean, readable code structure
   - Remove unused CSS properties and duplicate lines
   - Test all coordinate conversions for mathematical accuracy

## 2. Interface Requirements
   - Remove unnecessary UI elements and buttons
   - Ensure all HTML elements have corresponding JavaScript functions
   - Use modern CSS (flexbox/grid) for responsive layout
   - Test mobile device compatibility
   - Maintain visual harmony and readability

## 3. Offline Functionality
   - Core coordinate calculations must work without internet connection
   - External CDN dependencies are acceptable only for non-essential features:
     * jsPDF - for PDF export
     * OpenLayers - for map visualization
     * html2canvas - for map screenshots
   - TXT import/export must work offline
   - Data validation must be built-in

## 4. Documentation Standards
   - README.md must be in English
   - Include clear usage instructions and system requirements
   - Document all supported coordinate systems with technical specifications
   - Specify which functions require internet connectivity
   - Update documentation when features change

## 5. Mathematical Accuracy
   - Implement precise geodetic transformation algorithms
   - Use standard Helmert transformation for datum shifts
   - Apply Transverse Mercator projection formulas correctly
   - Include browser compatibility polyfills for mathematical functions
   - Validate results against known reference points

## 6. Repository Management
   - Use .gitignore to exclude development files (rules.txt, screenshots, etc.)
   - Publish only essential files: HTML, Function.txt, README.md, .gitignore
   - Follow semantic versioning for releases
   - Keep commit messages descriptive and in English

## 7. Quality Assurance
   - Test coordinate transformations with known control points
   - Verify PDF export functionality
   - Check map visualization accuracy
   - Test file import/export with various data formats
   - Validate browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)

## 8. Project Structure
   ```
   coordinate-transformer.html  # Main application (self-contained)
   Function.txt                # Mathematical algorithm documentation
   README.md                   # Project documentation
   .gitignore                  # Git exclusion rules
   ```
